# Track B: performance log

Board runs are identified by the commit the board measured. Local numbers are the in-process time on the full
seed-1 data in a 12-CPU Docker container on a Windows laptop (`tools/ab.py`: variants interleaved, median of 7-11 runs).
They are only used to compare variants, never reported as results.

## Board runs

| Step | Change | Run (commit) | T (s) | M (MB) | Points |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 0 | The reference, unchanged | | 56.35 | 2200 | 0 |
| 1 | Baseline: query terms interned in a hash table, parallel corpus scan keeping postings only for query terms, sorted-list merges for BOOL, candidate intersection plus re-tokenising for PHRASE | 6ee4e92 | 0.772 | 328 | 50.613 (K 10.29, 334 lines) |
| 2 | Binary-search probing for lopsided intersections, SWAR tokeniser, bigram postings for phrases | pending | | | |

## Local measurements behind step 2 (in-process ms, median)

| Variant | Median | Verdict |
|---|---|---|
| Step 1 | 771 | |
| `combine` probes the long list by binary search when one side is 16x shorter | 678 | kept: AND/NOT with a short running set no longer walks a 100k-id list |
| Streaming shift-and phrase matcher instead of building token spans | 661 vs 655 | no change; kept (no allocation) |
| SWAR tokeniser (classify 8 bytes per step, hash 8-byte words) | 684 vs 697 | no change at all, so the scan is not limited by byte handling; kept, it is what the phrase verifier uses |
| Bigram postings: the scan also records, per document, each adjacent pair of phrase terms | 562 vs 646 | kept: a 2-term phrase is exactly its pair list; longer phrases intersect pair lists, so only a handful of candidates need re-tokenising (candidates were 214k docs / 439 MB before) |
| Dense terms (sampled df over 1/32) as shared bitsets instead of pair lists | 587 vs 560; `memory.peak` 270 vs 359 MB | reverted: -89 MB, but not faster and +45 lines, about break-even on the score |

## Where the time goes now (ms, local, 12 threads)

query parse 40 (single thread), scan 340-360, posting build 40, answering 100.
Scan ablation (wall ms): tokenising only 78, +key and hash 105, +table probe 200, +used/last check 245, +bigram
probe and pair push 340-380. About 75% of corpus tokens are query terms, so the table lookup is a hit path:
cache misses on slots, keys and per-thread `last`, plus unpredictable branches.

A touch-only pass over the whole mapped corpus takes 3 ms, so page faults are not the cost.

## Ideas not done yet

- One record per table slot (fingerprint, key, flags) so a hit costs one cache miss instead of three.
- Pairs packed into 4 bytes (term 17 bits, document-in-chunk 13 bits) to cut the intermediate arrays; 14.9-24.9 M pairs
  at 8 bytes each are most of the memory.
- Parallel query parsing; PGO and `target-cpu=native` last.
